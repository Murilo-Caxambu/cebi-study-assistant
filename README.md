## About the Project

[cite_start]**Cebi - Study Assistant** is a personal study assistant designed to optimize your academic journey[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Inspired by tools like YPT and Microsoft To-Do, this project aims to help students manage their time and tasks, increasing productivity and organization[cite: 1].

Key features include:
* [cite_start]Study time tracking with a stopwatch and a timer[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]Task list management with priorities and subtasks[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]Resources for notes and documents to centralize study materials[cite: 2].

This project is a learning journey to consolidate my knowledge in Software Engineering and will be added to my portfolio.

## System Requirements

Cebi's requirements were gathered to ensure the project meets all end-user needs. They are divided into functional and non-functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements (RFs)
Here are the main functional requirements, based on defined priorities.

#### High Priority
* [cite_start]**RF-001** and **RF-002**: The system must allow user registration and login with email and password[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-005** and **RF-006**: The system must allow the user to start a stopwatch or a timer to track study time[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-007**: The system must allow the user to stop the timer or stopwatch at any time[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-010** and **RF-011**: The system must allow the user to add activities to a to-do list and mark them as complete or incomplete[cite: 2].

#### Medium and Low Priority (Future Features)
* [cite_start]**RF-004**: Password recovery via email[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-008** and **RF-009**: Classification of study sessions and tasks with custom tags[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-012** and **RF-013**: Subdividing tasks and classifying them by priority[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RF-014** to **RF-023**: Modules for notes, documents, flashcards, and an AI-powered video summary feature[cite: 2].

### Non-Functional Requirements (RNFs)

* [cite_start]**RNF-001**: The system will be developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **Node.js**, and **Python**[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RNF-002**: The code will be created in a **modular** fashion, allowing for future modifications and expansions[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RNF-003**: The system must be **intuitive**, allowing a new user to perform core functions within the first 2 minutes of use[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**RNF-004**: The application will be **responsive**, adapting to mobile devices[cite: 2].
