## About the Project

**Cebi - Study Assistant** is a personal study assistant designed to optimize your academic journey. Inspired by tools like YPT and Microsoft To-Do, this project aims to help students manage their time and tasks, increasing productivity and organization.

Key features include:
* Study time tracking with a stopwatch and a timer.
* Task list management with priorities and subtasks.
* Resources for notes and documents to centralize study materials.

This project is a learning journey to consolidate my knowledge in Software Engineering and will be added to my portfolio.

## System Requirements

Cebi's requirements were gathered to ensure the project meets all end-user needs. They are divided into functional and non-functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements (RFs)
Here are the main functional requirements, based on defined priorities.

#### High Priority
* **RF-001** and **RF-002**: The system must allow user registration and login with email and password.
* **RF-005** and **RF-006**: The system must allow the user to start a stopwatch or a timer to track study time.
* **RF-007**: The system must allow the user to stop the timer or stopwatch at any time.
* **RF-010** and **RF-011**: The system must allow the user to add activities to a to-do list and mark them as complete or incomplete.

#### Medium and Low Priority (Future Features)
* **RF-004**: Password recovery via email.
* **RF-008** and **RF-009**: Classification of study sessions and tasks with custom tags.
* **RF-012** and **RF-013**: Subdividing tasks and classifying them by priority.
* **RF-014** to **RF-023**: Modules for notes, documents, flashcards, and an AI-powered video summary feature.

### Non-Functional Requirements (RNFs)

* **RNF-001**: The system will be developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, **Node.js**, and **Python**.
* **RNF-002**: The code will be created in a **modular** fashion, allowing for future modifications and expansions.
* **RNF-003**: The system must be **intuitive**, allowing a new user to perform core functions within the first 2 minutes of use.
* **RNF-004**: The application will be **responsive**, adapting to mobile devices.
